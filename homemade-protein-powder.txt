Here’s the dietitian’s recipe for simple homemade protein powder – using a surprise budget-friendly protein source and a natural thickener.

Each 1/2 cup-scoop of my Homemade Protein Powder has 140 calories and 10 grams of protein. To make it I combined:

Dry milk powder: A 1/3 cup serving has just 80 calories, a whopping 8 grams of protein, including whey protein, AND 8 essential nutrients.
Dry oats: A natural thickener because oats ‘plump’ in liquid. All oats are a healthy whole grain with significant amounts of fiber. Plus some researchers have show oatmeal has a special type of fiber that helps you feel fuller longer.
Almonds: Contains fiber and heart-healthy fats.

Combine my Homemade Protein Powder (recipe below) in the following quick recipes for a protein-packed grab-and-go-breakfast that will do your body good plus keep you going all morning. These are also some of this dietitian’s favorite ways to refuel after a workout. Use a 1/2-cup scoop (46.2 gm) of Homemade Protein Powder:

Berry Berry Smoothie: 1 scoop Homemade Protein Power + 1/2 cup plain (or flavored) Greek yogurt + 1 cup milk + 1 cup berries = 31 g protein
Extra Creamy Chocolate Smoothie: 1 scoop Homemade Protein Power + 1 cup milk + 1/4 avocado +1 tablespoon cocoa powder = 18 g protein
 Sweet Potato Pie Smoothie: 1 scoop Homemade Protein Power + 1 cup milk + 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice + 1/4 cup canned sweet potatoes = 17 g protein

 Here's the dietitian's recipe for simple homemade protein powder - using a surprise budget-friendly ingredient.

 Ingredients

 3 cups (240 gm) instant nonfat dry milk, divided
 1 cup (80 gm) old fashioned or instant dry oats
 1 cup (142 gm) almonds
 Sweetener of your choice
 Directions

 Place 1 cup instant dry milk, 1 cup oats, 1 cup almonds in blender. Pulse until smooth.
 Place remaining instant dry milk in blender and pulse just a few times until blended.
 Place in container and cover tightly. Keep at a cool room temperature if you use within 2 weeks - if storing longer store in the refrigerator so the nuts don't go rancid.
 To use, scoop 1/2 cup into 1/2-1 cup liquid in a blender; if possible let set 5-10 minutes for oats to plump. Add additional fruits, flavorings, yogurt or milks of your choice. Vanilla or almond extract is especially delicious.
